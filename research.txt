# Grouping Detailed Level 3 Events into Higher-Level Activities for Process Mining

## Introduction

When working with event logs that consist of fine-grained, detailed events (Level 3), it's often necessary to **aggregate or generalize** these events into higher-level activities (Level 2 or Level 1) to facilitate effective process mining and analysis. This grouping can help in:

- Simplifying complex process models.
- Focusing on the overall process flow rather than intricate details.
- Making the models more interpretable for stakeholders.

This document provides guidance on how to group Level 3 events into Level 2 or Level 1 activities, discussing whether this should be done during process mining or as a pre-processing step, along with examples and best practices.

---

## Approaches to Grouping Events

There are two main approaches to grouping detailed events into higher-level activities:

1. **Pre-Processing (Data Preparation Phase):** Aggregating events before performing process mining.
2. **On-the-Fly Abstraction (During Process Mining):** Grouping events dynamically during the process mining analysis.

### 1. Pre-Processing (Data Preparation Phase)

**Definition:**

- **Pre-processing** involves transforming the event log before process mining, grouping detailed events into higher-level activities based on predefined rules or mappings.

**Process:**

- **Define Aggregation Rules:** Establish how Level 3 events map to Level 2 and Level 1 activities using domain knowledge.
- **Aggregate Events:** Use these rules to combine detailed events into higher-level activities.
- **Update Event Log:** Create a new event log that includes these aggregated activities.

**Advantages:**

- **Controlled Aggregation:** Ensures consistent grouping across the dataset.
- **Simplified Models:** Reduces complexity before analysis, leading to clearer process models.
- **Performance Improvement:** Smaller logs can improve the efficiency of process mining algorithms.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Loss of Detail:** May lose granular information if original events are not retained.
- **Effort Required:** Requires upfront effort to define aggregation rules and transform the data.

### 2. On-the-Fly Abstraction (During Process Mining)

**Definition:**

- **On-the-fly abstraction** refers to grouping events dynamically during the process mining phase, often using features provided by process mining tools.

**Process:**

- **Use Tool Features:** Leverage abstraction or filtering functionalities within process mining tools to group events.
- **Dynamic Aggregation:** Adjust the level of detail interactively during analysis.

**Advantages:**

- **Flexibility:** Allows analysts to change the level of abstraction without modifying the original data.
- **Detail Preservation:** Original detailed events remain available for analysis.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Tool Limitations:** Not all process mining tools support advanced abstraction features.
- **Computational Overhead:** May increase processing time, especially with large datasets.
- **Inconsistent Grouping:** Dynamic grouping may lead to inconsistencies if not carefully managed.

## Techniques for Grouping Events

### Manual Mapping Using Domain Knowledge

**Process:**

- **Create Mapping Tables:** Define how detailed events map to higher-level activities based on understanding of the process.
- **Example Mapping:**

  | Level 3 Event             | Level 2 Activity      | Level 1 Activity |
  |---------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|
  | `Validate Username`       | `User Validation`     | `Authentication` |
  | `Validate Password`       | `User Validation`     | `Authentication` |
  | `Check Permissions`       | `Authorization`       | `Authentication` |
  | `Load Dashboard`          | `Dashboard Access`    | `Main Process`   |
  | `Fetch Data`              | `Data Retrieval`      | `Main Process`   |

**Advantages:**

- **Accuracy:** Leverages domain expertise to ensure meaningful groupings.
- **Transparency:** Clear documentation of how events are grouped.

**Disadvantages:**

# Strategy for Storing Event Logs as JSON to Support Real-Time Generalization and Specialization in Process Mining

## Introduction

In process mining, it's crucial to store event logs in a way that allows for both **generalization** and **specialization** during real-time analysis. This flexibility enables analysts to zoom in on detailed activities or abstract them into higher-level overviews as needed. Storing event data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) provides a flexible and hierarchical format suitable for this purpose.

This document outlines a strategy for structuring event logs as JSON to facilitate real-time generalization and specialization during process mining. It covers the design principles, data structure, inclusion of hierarchical levels, metadata, and best practices to achieve the desired flexibility in analysis.

---

## Strategy Overview

**Objective:** Store event logs in JSON format in a way that:

- Supports hierarchical representation of activities.
- Allows dynamic aggregation (generalization) and disaggregation (specialization) during mining.
- Facilitates efficient querying and processing by mining tools.
- Preserves all necessary information for detailed analysis.

**Approach:**

1. **Design a Hierarchical Data Structure:**
   - Represent events with nested structures to reflect different levels of activities.
   - Include parent-child relationships between events.

2. **Include Metadata and Attributes:**
   - Add attributes that provide context and support filtering (e.g., `event_level`, `activity_type`).

3. **Ensure Compatibility with Mining Tools:**
   - Structure the data to be easily converted into formats required by process mining tools (e.g., pandas DataFrame for PM4Py).

4. **Facilitate Real-Time Analysis:**
   - Store data in a database or data store that supports efficient querying (e.g., MongoDB).
   - Design the schema to enable fast aggregation and filtering.

---

## JSON Data Structure

### Key Components:

1. **Case (Process Instance):**
   - Represents a single instance of the process.
   - Identified by a unique `case_id`.

2. **Event:**
   - Represents an occurrence within a case.
   - Contains details like `event_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`, and `event_level`.

3. **Hierarchical Levels:**
   - Events can be nested to represent hierarchical activities.
   - `event_level` indicates the level of abstraction (e.g., 1 for high-level, 2 for mid-level, 3 for detailed).

4. **Attributes:**
   - Additional data to provide context (e.g., `resource`, `location`, `application`).

### Example Structure:

```json
[
  {
    "case_id": "Case_1",
    "events": [
      {
        "event_id": "E1",
        "activity": "Order Processing",
        "timestamp": "2023-01-01T08:00:00Z",
        "event_level": 1,
        "attributes": {
          "application": "OrderSystem",
          "resource": "User123"
        },
        "sub_events": [
          {
            "event_id": "E1.1",
            "activity": "Validate Order",
            "timestamp": "2023-01-01T08:05:00Z",
            "event_level": 2,
            "attributes": {
              "application": "ValidationService"
            },
            "sub_events": [
              {
                "event_id": "E1.1.1",
                "activity": "Check Inventory",
                "timestamp": "2023-01-01T08:05:30Z",
                "event_level": 3,
                "attributes": {
                  "application": "InventoryService"
                }
              },
              {
                "event_id": "E1.1.2",
                "activity": "Verify Payment",
                "timestamp": "2023-01-01T08:06:00Z",
                "event_level": 3,
                "attributes": {
                  "application": "PaymentGateway"
                }
              }

## Including Hierarchical Levels

### Representing Hierarchies:

- **Nested `sub_events`:**
  - Use the `sub_events` array within each event to represent child events.
  - This nesting continues recursively to capture multiple levels.

### `event_level` Attribute:

- **Purpose:**
  - Indicates the level of abstraction.
  - Allows filtering events based on their level during mining.

- **Usage:**
  - Level 1: High-level activities.
  - Level 2: Mid-level activities.
  - Level 3: Detailed activities.

---

## Metadata and Attributes

Including metadata enhances the flexibility and richness of the event logs.

### Essential Attributes:

- **`case_id`:** Unique identifier for the process instance.
- **`event_id`:** Unique identifier for the event.
- **`activity`:** Name of the activity.
- **`timestamp`:** ISO 8601 formatted timestamp.
- **`event_level`:** Numeric value indicating the abstraction level.

### Additional Attributes:

- **`attributes`:** A dictionary to include custom key-value pairs.
  - **Examples:**
    - `application`: Name of the application where the event originated.
    - `resource`: The user or system component performing the activity.
    - `location`: Physical or logical location.

### Benefits:

- **Filtering:** Enables filtering events based on attributes (e.g., only events from a specific application).
- **Aggregation:** Supports grouping events during mining (e.g., by `resource`).

---

## Generalization and Specialization During Mining

### How the Structure Supports Real-Time Analysis:

1. **Filtering by `event_level`:**
   - Analysts can select events up to a certain level to generalize the process model.
   - Example: Selecting only events with `event_level` ≤ 2 for a high-level overview.

2. **Dynamic Aggregation:**
   - Mining tools can aggregate nested `sub_events` into their parent activities based on the `event_level`.
   - This allows switching between detailed and abstract views without modifying the data.

3. **Attribute-Based Filtering:**
   - Use attributes to include or exclude events during analysis.
   - Example: Analyzing events from a specific application or resource.

### Implementation in Mining Tools:

- **Data Transformation:**
  - Convert the JSON data into the format required by the mining tool (e.g., a flat table or event log).
  - Use recursive functions to flatten the nested structure as needed.

- **Real-Time Querying:**
  - When stored in a database like MongoDB, queries can extract events based on `event_level` and attributes efficiently.

- **Support in Mining Tools:**
  - **PM4Py:** Supports filtering and abstraction based on event attributes.
  - **ProM:** Offers plugins for event abstraction and hierarchical analysis.

## Best Practices

### Designing the JSON Structure:

- **Consistent Schema:**
  - Ensure all events follow the same structure for consistency.

- **Unique Identifiers:**
  - Use unique `event_id` and `case_id` values to prevent ambiguity.

- **Timestamp Precision:**
  - Use precise timestamps to maintain the correct sequence of events.

### Data Storage:

- **Database Use:**
  - Store the JSON data in a document-oriented database (e.g., MongoDB) to support efficient querying and scalability.

- **Indexing:**
  - Index on frequently queried fields like `case_id`, `event_level`, and `timestamp` to improve performance.

### Data Integrity:

- **Validation:**
  - Validate the JSON data against a schema to ensure required fields are present.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Implement error handling for missing or malformed data.

### Documentation:

- **Schema Documentation:**
  - Maintain clear documentation of the JSON schema, including descriptions of each field.

- **Aggregation Rules:**
  - Document any rules or logic used for aggregating events during mining.

---

## Example: Mining Process with Generalization

1. **Data Extraction:**

   - Extract events from the JSON data based on desired `event_level`.

     ```python
     def extract_events(data, max_level):
         events = []
         def recurse(event):
             if event['event_level'] <= max_level:
                 events.append(event)
             if 'sub_events' in event:
                 for sub_event in event['sub_events']:
                     recurse(sub_event)
         for case in data:
             for event in case['events']:
                 recurse(event)
         return events
     ```

2. **Data Transformation:**

   - Flatten the extracted events into a tabular format for mining.

3. **Process Mining:**

   - Use the transformed data in a mining tool, applying filters or abstractions as needed.
