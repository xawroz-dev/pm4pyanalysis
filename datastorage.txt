### Choosing the Best Way to Store Event Data for Process Mining and Querying

Your situation requires a data storage approach that:
1. **Supports querying across multiple applications and journeys.**
2. **Facilitates process mining and visualization.**
3. **Maintains flexibility and scalability for a large volume of multilevel events.**

Here’s a detailed evaluation of the **two storage approaches**—combined journey documents vs. individual events—and the significance of **JSON vs. XES/JSON-XES** formats.

---

### **1. Combined Journey Document vs. Individual Application Events**

#### Combined Journey Document:
This approach involves pre-grouping all events in a journey (across applications) into a single document, structured around a shared correlation ID (`case_id`).

- **Advantages:**
  1. **Easier to Analyze Complete Journeys:**
     - A single document provides a holistic view of the entire journey, making downstream analysis simpler for specific processes.
  2. **Reduced Processing Overhead:**
     - No need to dynamically group individual events during querying, saving time and resources.
  3. **Efficient for Journey-Level Reporting:**
     - Useful for generating high-level insights like total journey duration, bottlenecks, or transitions between applications.

- **Disadvantages:**
  1. **Limited Flexibility for Ad-hoc Queries:**
     - Filtering individual events becomes more complex when they are nested within a journey document.
  2. **Storage Complexity:**
     - Maintaining nested structures (e.g., JSON with arrays of events) can complicate storage and indexing.

#### Individual Application Events:
This approach stores each event as a separate, atomic record, tagged with metadata like `case_id`, `application_name`, `timestamp`, and other attributes.

- **Advantages:**
  1. **High Query Flexibility:**
     - Individual events can be filtered, grouped, and joined dynamically based on use cases, such as analyzing specific applications or time ranges.
  2. **Scalable and Simple:**
     - Flat storage (e.g., row-based or JSON records) is easier to scale and maintain.
  3. **Supports Incremental Ingestion:**
     - Events can be ingested and stored independently without waiting for the entire journey to complete.

- **Disadvantages:**
  1. **Dynamic Grouping Overhead:**
     - For journey-level analysis, individual events must be grouped on-the-fly using `case_id` during querying, which may add processing time.
  2. **Harder to Visualize Journey States Directly:**
     - Requires additional processing to visualize the flow between applications.

---

### **Recommendation: Individual Events with Dynamic Grouping**
- Store individual application events for better **querying flexibility** and **scalability**.
- Use tools like **Elasticsearch**, **Snowflake**, or **BigQuery** for efficient querying and grouping at runtime.
- If journey-level analysis is frequent, consider materializing **pre-grouped journey views** periodically (e.g., daily or hourly).

---

### **2. JSON vs. XES/JSON-XES Formats**

#### JSON Format:
- **Structure:** Flexible, widely used for storing semi-structured data.
- **Advantages:**
  1. **Query Flexibility:**
     - JSON is easily indexed and queryable in modern databases (e.g., Elasticsearch, BigQuery, MongoDB).
     - Supports multilevel categorization and tagging for flexible analytics.
  2. **Industry Support:**
     - Works seamlessly with visualization tools, dashboards, and BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Kibana.
  3. **Efficient for Storage:**
     - Compact compared to verbose formats like XML (used in XES).
  4. **Easily Extensible:**
     - Adding new attributes or categories doesn’t require schema evolution as in relational databases.

#### XES or JSON-XES Format:
- **Structure:** XES (Extensible Event Stream) is hierarchical and XML-based, with JSON-XES as a JSON-compatible alternative.
- **Advantages:**
  1. **Process Mining Compatibility:**
     - Specifically designed for process mining tools (e.g., ProM, Celonis).
     - Contains metadata fields (e.g., `case_id`, `event`, `timestamp`) to standardize event representation.
  2. **Interoperability:**
     - Easier to integrate with process mining tools without additional transformation.

- **Disadvantages:**
  1. **Query Limitations:**
     - XES/JSON-XES is not optimized for querying or ad-hoc analytics. It's primarily a batch format for process mining.
  2. **Storage Overhead:**
     - More verbose compared to JSON or Parquet.
  3. **Processing Overhead:**
     - Requires additional effort to convert raw logs into XES format during ingestion or post-processing.

---

### **Recommendation: JSON with Optional JSON-XES Export**
- Store events in **JSON** for flexibility, scalability, and queryability.
- For tools requiring XES, generate **JSON-XES or XES files** on-demand by grouping events from JSON storage.

---

### **3. Why JSON is the Best Choice for Your Use Case**
Here’s how JSON addresses your requirements:

| **Requirement**                        | **JSON**                                                     | **XES/JSON-XES**                                           |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Queryable data**                     | Easily indexed and queried in modern systems.              | Requires pre-parsing and transformation for querying.    |
| **Scalability**                        | Lightweight, scalable for large datasets.                  | Verbose and less efficient for large-scale storage.      |
| **Flexibility (categories/tags)**      | Supports multilevel tagging and attributes natively.        | Can support attributes but adds complexity in querying.  |
| **Real-time analysis**                 | JSON can be queried and processed in real-time systems.     | Better suited for batch processing.                     |
| **Process mining compatibility**       | Requires transformation into XES for process mining tools. | Directly compatible with process mining tools.          |

### **4. Practical Implementation Plan**

#### 1. **Event Storage: JSON in a Data Lake**
- Store all events in JSON format in a scalable data lake like **Amazon S3** or **Google Cloud Storage**.
- Organize by `application_name`, `case_id`, and `timestamp` for efficient retrieval.

#### 2. **Indexing and Querying: Elasticsearch or BigQuery**
- Index JSON records in **Elasticsearch** or **BigQuery** for real-time filtering and querying.

#### 3. **Process Mining Integration: JSON-XES Export**
- When needed, transform JSON into **JSON-XES** or **XES** for tools like ProM or Celonis using a periodic job or an on-demand API.

#### 4. **Categorization and Visualization**
- Use JSON tags and attributes for flexible categorization.
- Leverage tools like **Power BI**, **Tableau**, or **Grafana** to visualize insights (e.g., process flows, bottlenecks).

---

### **5. Summary for Your Director**
- **Storage Format:** Use JSON for storing event data due to its flexibility, queryability, and scalability.
- **Querying Approach:** Utilize modern databases (e.g., BigQuery or Elasticsearch) to query events dynamically by `case_id`, `timestamp`, or other attributes.
- **Process Mining Compatibility:** Generate XES or JSON-XES on-demand for process mining tools.
- **Benefits of JSON:**
  - Scalable for high-volume data.
  - Supports ad-hoc filtering and dynamic analytics.
  - Flexible for tagging and multilevel categorization.

Your concerns are absolutely valid, and you're right to question the practical use of XES (or AXS as you mentioned, which I assume is a typo for XES) in the context of continuous data streams and scalability. Let me clarify and provide examples to address these specific points:

---

### 1. **How to Create XES Files from Continuous Streams**
- **Continuous Stream Problem:**
  XES is inherently a **batch-oriented** format, meaning it's best suited for post-processed event data grouped into **traces** (i.e., events with the same Case ID). This makes it challenging to apply directly to continuous, real-time data streams.

- **Solution: Hybrid Approach**
  Instead of creating XES files continuously, follow a **streaming-to-batch approach**:
  1. **Ingest Logs Continuously:** Collect logs from your systems using Kafka or similar tools.
  2. **Group Logs Dynamically:** Use stream processing tools like Apache Flink or Spark Streaming to group events by their `Case ID` in near-real-time.
  3. **Generate XES Periodically:**
      - At intervals (e.g., every hour or day), convert grouped logs into XES format for downstream process mining.
      - Each XES file contains multiple traces for events that occurred during the interval.

- **Why Thousands of XES Files Aren't Ideal:**
  Instead of creating thousands of small XES files (one per process), aggregate them into **larger files** with multiple traces. For instance:
  - File `day_2024_11_26.xes` could contain all traces for the day, grouped by Case ID.

---

### 2. **Querying and Filtering Data with XES**
XES isn't ideal for querying/filtering due to its hierarchical structure. Here's why and how to handle it:
- **Problem:**
  If you want to filter events (e.g., for the last 5 days), XES lacks efficient querying mechanisms for large datasets. Filtering involves either:
  - Parsing and iterating through the file.
  - Pre-processing to extract relevant traces into a new file.

- **Solution: Parallel Storage**
  Store logs in two ways:
  1. **Event Storage for Querying:**
     - Store events in a **queryable format** like JSON, Parquet, or a relational database. This allows you to filter and query efficiently.
     - Example:
       - Query: "Find all events between Nov 21 and Nov 26 where `activity_name = 'Order Approved'`."
       - Storage: BigQuery, Snowflake, or Elasticsearch.
  2. **XES for Process Mining:**
     - Use the filtered results from the queryable storage to generate XES files on-demand for process mining tools like ProM or Celonis.

---

### 3. **How XES Could Work for Process Mining**
- **Example: Filtering for Process Mining**
  Suppose you want to analyze the processes that occurred in the last 5 days:
  1. **Step 1:** Query raw logs:
     - Example SQL Query:
       ```sql
       SELECT *
       FROM events
       WHERE timestamp >= '2024-11-21' AND timestamp <= '2024-11-26';
       ```
  2. **Step 2:** Group by Case ID:
     - Group events using their `case_id` and order them by timestamp.
  3. **Step 3:** Generate XES File:
     - Transform the grouped results into XES format using libraries (e.g., `xes-lite` in Python or custom converters).
     - Example XES Structure:
       ```xml
       <log>
         <trace>
           <event>
             <string key="activity" value="Order Created"/>
             <date key="timestamp" value="2024-11-21T12:00:00"/>
           </event>
           <event>
             <string key="activity" value="Order Approved"/>
             <date key="timestamp" value="2024-11-21T12:05:00"/>
           </event>
         </trace>
       </log>
       ```

---

### 4. **Why XES May Not Be Scalable**
- **Not Query-Friendly:** XES files must be parsed entirely, making it inefficient for selective filtering or large-scale queries.
- **File Size and Complexity:** As the number of events grows, XES files become larger and harder to process, especially if you store metadata-rich events.

---

### 5. **Alternative Architecture for Scalability**
If your goal is both real-time filtering and process mining, consider this architecture:

#### **Primary Data Store for Querying**
- **Storage:** Use a scalable data lake (S3, GCS) with Parquet or JSON for raw logs.
- **Indexing:** Use Elasticsearch for real-time querying of metadata-rich events.

#### **Derived XES Generation**
- **Filtered Events:** Query the data lake or Elasticsearch for events of interest (e.g., last 5 days).
- **Batch Processing:** Use Spark or Flink to group events by `Case ID` and convert them into XES files for process mining tools.

---

### 6. **Concrete Use Case Example**
#### Scenario:
You want to analyze processes from the last 5 days, focusing on cases where an "Order Approved" event occurred.

#### Steps:
1. **Query Logs:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM events
   WHERE timestamp >= '2024-11-21' AND timestamp <= '2024-11-26'
     AND event_name = 'Order Approved';
   ```
2. **Group Events:**
   - Group by `case_id`.
   - Order by `timestamp`.
3. **Generate XES:**
   - Transform the grouped results into an XES file:
     ```xml
     <log>
       <trace>
         <event>
           <string key="activity" value="Order Created"/>
           <date key="timestamp" value="2024-11-21T08:00:00"/>
         </event>
         <event>
           <string key="activity" value="Order Approved"/>
           <date key="timestamp" value="2024-11-21T08:15:00"/>
         </event>
       </trace>
     </log>
     ```

---

### 7. **When Not to Use XES**
If real-time querying and filtering are the primary requirements:
- Use **JSON, Parquet, or columnar databases** for your data store.
- Only convert to XES **when specifically required** for process mining tools.

---

### Final Recommendation:
Use a hybrid approach:
1. **Store raw events in queryable formats (JSON, Parquet, or Elasticsearch).**
2. **Generate XES files on-demand for specific use cases requiring process mining tools.**
3. **Leverage real-time querying systems like Elasticsearch for rapid analysis.**

This way, you maintain scalability and efficiency while adhering to process mining standards like XES only when absolutely necessary.
