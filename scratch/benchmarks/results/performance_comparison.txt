ANALYSIS & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

SOLUTION OVERVIEW:

1. Apache AGE (PostgreSQL + Graph Extension)
   - Hybrid SQL/Graph database
   - Uses Cypher query language
   - Leverages PostgreSQL's ACID guarantees
   - Good for: Organizations already using PostgreSQL

2. Neo4j (Native Graph Database)
   - Industry-standard graph database
   - Mature ecosystem and tooling
   - Excellent documentation
   - Good for: Graph-first applications, complex traversals

3. ArangoDB (Multi-Model Database)
   - Supports documents, graphs, and key-value
   - Flexible data modeling
   - AQL query language
   - Good for: Applications needing multiple data models

4. Memgraph (In-Memory Graph Database)
   - High-performance in-memory processing
   - Cypher compatible
   - Fast for real-time analytics
   - Good for: Low-latency requirements, streaming data

5. PostgreSQL Recursive (Pure Relational)
   - No graph extension needed
   - Uses recursive CTEs for graph traversal
   - Standard SQL
   - Good for: Simple use cases, avoiding new dependencies

6. NetworkX (In-Memory Python Library)
   - Pure Python, no database
   - Excellent for prototyping
   - No persistence overhead
   - Good for: Baseline performance, small datasets, testing

================================================================================
EXPECTED PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
================================================================================

INGESTION:
- Fastest: NetworkX (in-memory, no I/O)
- Fast: Memgraph, PostgreSQL Recursive (simple inserts)
- Moderate: Neo4j, ArangoDB, Apache AGE (graph overhead)

PROCESSING:
- Fastest: NetworkX (native Python graph algorithms)
- Fast: Memgraph (in-memory graph operations)
- Moderate: Neo4j, Apache AGE (optimized graph queries)
- Slower: ArangoDB, PostgreSQL Recursive (more complex queries)

SCALABILITY:
- Best: Neo4j, Memgraph (designed for large graphs)
- Good: Apache AGE, ArangoDB (distributed options available)
- Limited: PostgreSQL Recursive (recursive CTEs can be slow)
- Poor: NetworkX (single-node, memory-limited)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION FOR JOURNEY STITCHING:
================================================================================

BEST OVERALL: Apache AGE
Reasons:
- Excellent balance of performance and features
- Leverages PostgreSQL's reliability and ACID guarantees
- Cypher queries are expressive for graph operations
- No need for separate database infrastructure
- Good performance with batch operations
- Mature PostgreSQL ecosystem (backup, monitoring, etc.)

BEST FOR PERFORMANCE: Memgraph
Reasons:
- In-memory processing for maximum speed
- Optimized for real-time event processing
- Excellent for high-throughput scenarios
- Trade-off: Requires more memory

BEST FOR SIMPLICITY: PostgreSQL Recursive
Reasons:
- No new dependencies or extensions
- Standard SQL that most teams understand
- Easy to debug and maintain
- Trade-off: Less expressive for complex graph queries

BEST FOR PROTOTYPING: NetworkX
Reasons:
- Quick to implement and test
- No infrastructure setup
- Great for algorithm development
- Trade-off: Not suitable for production (no persistence)

================================================================================
FINAL RECOMMENDATION:
================================================================================

For production journey stitching at scale, we recommend **Apache AGE** because:

1. **Proven Reliability**: Built on PostgreSQL's battle-tested foundation
2. **Graph Expressiveness**: Cypher queries naturally express stitching logic
3. **Operational Simplicity**: Single database for both relational and graph data
4. **Performance**: Batch operations and in-memory clustering provide good speed
5. **Ecosystem**: Leverage PostgreSQL tools for monitoring, backup, replication
6. **Cost-Effective**: No additional licensing (open source)
7. **Flexibility**: Can fall back to SQL for complex analytics

If your primary concern is **maximum throughput** and you can afford the memory,
consider **Memgraph** as it offers the best raw performance for real-time processing.

If you need **multi-model capabilities** (documents + graphs), **ArangoDB** is
an excellent choice with good performance and flexibility.
